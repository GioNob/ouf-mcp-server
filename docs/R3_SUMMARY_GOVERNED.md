# R3 summary execution and evidence

This increment prepares `ouf.operations.summary` for a governed end-to-end
path. It does not certify a live installation or full R3 acceptance.

## Normative alignment

The attached Reality Baseline v1.7 was extracted without changes; all 323
SHA256SUMS entries matched. Consulted L0 Blueprint v0.3, Matrix v1.7 and
Terminology Notice v1.1, and the scope/invariants of all seven PETs. Targeted
requirements: MCP v1.4 §§33–34; Authorization v1.5 §34; Gateway v1.5 §§34–35;
Ingestion v1.3 §46. Onboarding v1.6 keeps configuration and THS ownership;
Semantic v1.3 retains TBox ownership; UDP v1.3 retains object/serving ownership.
No new central incident service, identity directory or human approval tool.

## Contract

The MCP private owner re-evaluates the current policy before reading state or
calling producers. Summary requests require TENANT_OPERATIONAL detail and the
same tenant/resource scope and decision reference; a public status grant is
not sufficient. Producer calls retain the request-only signed delegation and
original client identity. Proofs are neither arguments nor persisted fields.
The HTTP client uses closed Gateway paths for the three summary capabilities.

The owner validates JSON, byte/limit/source bounds, and an RFC3339 since value.
Default catch-up is 24 hours; maximum requested lookback is 30 days. These are
query bounds, not scheduler or retention changes. Producers compute current
health independently from the catch-up window.

The aggregator accepts only known status/completeness/module values, applies
an output allowlist and a deterministic global incident-item budget, and
preserves incompleteness including its own MCP producer. A denied producer
fails the aggregate with NOT_AUTHORIZED, without an incident payload. Failed,
malformed or unavailable producers yield partial DEGRADED; UNKNOWN never
becomes HEALTHY. Protected classes and arbitrary producer fields are omitted.
The incidents sibling now also requires owner authorization; its broader
pagination/lifecycle completion is outside this increment.

## Verification

Local Go test ./... passed; database and external pairwise cases retain their
explicit environment skips. Race tests passed for operational, orchestration
and HTTP client packages. Added owner-denial-before-read, malformed evidence,
redaction, producer denial and fixed Gateway path/delegation tests.
Gateway's companion PR supplies generated Lua tests and extends its real
APISIX/OIDC CI test; that is separate from a live OUF installation.

## Release gates still required

Deploy compatible owner implementations before enabling the new routes. The
Gateway operational owner currently exposes a Python hosting contract, not a
complete production server; the new summary path refuses operation without a
local authorization adapter and an explicitly bound tenant. Ingestion needs
its genuine authenticated principal/SDK binding; reconstructed HTTP headers
alone do not constitute that binding. Do not replace these with test actors.
These are explicit integration gates, not a reason to broaden grants.

Use the current Onboarding policy workflow for summary and producer grants,
reviewed and published by a human. Register compatible descriptors and scopes,
then retain allow/deny/partial and offline-catch-up evidence with image and
policy versions. No permission was granted or deployment performed here.

## Authorization checkpoint from the working session

The existing THS feedback record documents nominal policy 9 and a successful
HEALTHY/PUBLIC_OPERATIONAL read. Later, the user reported removing the IAM role
collaudo-funzionario-informatico; one giovanni-chatgpt status read returned
non-retryable authorization denied. The read catalogue had operational-viewer
assigned to that IAM role. This is expected negative evidence, not an incident
to repair. The exact later policy version and revocation latency are not
available in that tool response and are not invented. ouf-admin can read the
role catalogue but also received a denied status read; administration is not
an automatic operational grant. No role restoration is part of this increment.
